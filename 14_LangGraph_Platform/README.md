# Build 🏗️

Run the repository and complete the following:

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #1 — Building and serving your LangGraph Agent Graph
  - Task 1: Getting Dependencies & Environment
    - Configure `.env` (OpenAI, Tavily, optional LangSmith)
  - Task 2: Serve the Graph Locally
    - `uv run langgraph dev` (API on http://localhost:2024)
  - Task 3: Call the API from a different terminal
    - `uv run test_served_graph.py` (sync SDK example)
  - Task 4: Explore assistants (from `langgraph.json`)
    - `agent` → `simple_agent` (tool-using agent)
    - `agent_helpful` → `agent_with_helpfulness` (separate helpfulness node)

- 🤝 Breakout Room Part #2 — Using LangGraph Studio to visualize the graph
  - Task 1: Open Studio while the server is running
    - https://smith.langchain.com/studio?baseUrl=http://localhost:2024
  - Task 2: Visualize & Stream
    - Start a run and observe node-by-node updates
  - Task 3: Compare Flows
    - Contrast `agent` vs `agent_helpful` (tool calls vs helpfulness decision)

## Activities and Questions 🏗️ &❓

#### ❓ Question 1:

Compare the `agent` and `agent_helpful` assistants defined in `langgraph.json`. Where does the helpfulness evaluator fit in the graph, and under what condition should execution route back to the agent vs. terminate?

##### ✅ Answer:

**Comparison:**
- The `agent` assistant uses `simple_agent` which terminates immediately after the agent produces a response without tool calls
- The `agent_helpful` assistant uses `agent_with_helpfulness` which includes an additional quality evaluation step before terminating

**Where the helpfulness evaluator fits:**
The helpfulness evaluator fits after the agent node when the agent produces a final response (no tool calls). The `route_to_action_or_helpfulness` function directs the flow to the `helpfulness` node instead of immediately terminating. The helpfulness node uses `gpt-4.1-mini` to evaluate whether the agent's response adequately addresses the initial user query.

**Routing conditions:**
- **Route back to agent ("continue")**: When the helpfulness evaluation returns "N" (response is NOT sufficiently helpful), the graph loops back to the agent node for another attempt
- **Terminate ("end")**: When the helpfulness evaluation returns "Y" (response IS helpful), or when the message count exceeds 10 (safety limit to prevent infinite loops)

This architecture ensures quality responses by implementing a feedback loop that only exits when the agent provides a truly helpful answer.

#### 🏗️ Activity #1 Debugging A Graph

Select the `agent_with_helpfulness` and set one or more interrupts (at least one `Before` and one `After`). Try changing values and continuing the turn. 

#### ❓ Question 2:

What are your thoughts on when you would use a Before interrupt vs. an After interrupt?

##### ✅ Answer:

**Before Interrupts** should be used when you need to:
- **Validate or modify inputs** before a node processes them
- **Test different scenarios** by changing what data enters a node
- **Implement human approval** before expensive or critical operations (e.g., before executing API calls, database writes, or tool actions)
- **Debug input data** to understand what a node is receiving

*Example from Activity #1:* Setting a Before interrupt on the `helpfulness` node allowed me to modify the agent's response before the helpfulness evaluator assessed it. This demonstrated how the loop-back mechanism works when responses are deemed unhelpful.

**After Interrupts** should be used when you need to:
- **Review or moderate outputs** after a node has completed its work
- **Modify results** before they flow to downstream nodes
- **Implement human-in-the-loop workflows** for content approval or quality assurance
- **Inspect completed work** to validate correctness before proceeding

**Key Insight:** Before interrupts focus on controlling *inputs* (what goes into a node), while After interrupts focus on controlling *outputs* (what comes out of a node). The choice depends on whether you need to intervene before processing occurs or after results are generated.
